# Card Sharks

This is my third iteration of a card matching memory game. First created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working collaboratively with classmates. After learning React, I recreated the same project with TypeScript and React. When my first develper role used Redux for state management, I decided to apply Redux to this project to really wrap my head around it.
